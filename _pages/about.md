I'm Xiaoze Fan (aka JasonFan), a third-year undergraduate of [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/html/zhiyuan/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), major in computer science.
Currently, I am a research intern at [Emerging Parallel Computer Center (EPCC Lab)](https://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn/), co-advised by Prof. [Quan Chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chen-quan/index_EN.html) and Postdoc. [Weihao Cui](https://raphael-hao.top/), and I'm looking for research internships for summer and fall of 2026.

My research interest lies in ML systems, particularly in building efficient systems for large language models.
